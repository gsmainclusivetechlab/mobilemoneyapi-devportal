1. Install dependencies
```npm
npm i
```
2. Development
If you want to use !!!include()!!! for including some md files in other md files, you have to use the following command:
```npm
npm run start
```

To develop without including files, you can just use dev command:
```npm
npm run dev
```
VuePress will start a hot-reloading development server at http://localhost:8080 if any of above commands is executed.


For build project run:

```npm
npm run build
```
