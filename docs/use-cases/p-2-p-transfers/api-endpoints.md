- The field **name**.
- The field **type**.
- **Description** of the field.

-> Request optionality

<- Response optionality

O    Field is optional

M    Field is mandatory

C    Field is conditional

NA    Field does not need to be supplied. If supplied, it will be ignored.

<br>

- **Reference** where the fields is a acollection/n array and/or is defined by another object.
- **Validation** applied to the field, including enumeration, field length and use of regular expressions to validate format.

Please note that string fields have a default maximum length of 256 characters unless specified otherwise.

## Transactions API

P2P Transfers can be created,  and viewed and updated using transactions APIs. The following paths are permitted:

*POST /transactions/type/transfer*. To create a P2P transfer.

*GET /transactions/{transactionReference}*. To view a P2P transfer.

The following paths are permitted:

| Operation | Path  | Description |
|:-----------|:-------|:-------------|
| Create | POST */transactions/type/{transactiontype}* | To be used for transaction creation when the providerâ€™s API Gateway requires that the transaction type be identified in the URL.  |
| View | GET */transactions/{transactionReference}* | To view a transaction. |
| Update | PATCH */transactions/{transactionReference}* | To update the transactionStatus of a transaction. |

## Reversals API

The Reversals API is used to reverse a P2P transfer. The originating transaction reference must be provided in the path to identify the payment to be reversed. For a partial reversal, the amount needs to be supplied. 

For viewing reversals, the [Transactions API](#transactions-api) should be used. For performing a reversal without the original transaction reference, use the [Transactions API](#transactions-api).
