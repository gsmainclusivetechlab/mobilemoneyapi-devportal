# API Endpoints

API endpoint fields are described in this specification as follows:

- The field **name**.
- The field **type**.
- **Description** of the field.
- **Optionality** of the field, i.e. whether the field must be supplied. Optionality is identified as per follows:

&#8594;&nbsp; Request optionality

&#8592;&nbsp; Response optionality

O&nbsp; Field is optional

M&nbsp; Field is mandatory

C&nbsp; Field is conditional

NA&nbsp; Field does not need to be supplied. If supplied, it will be ignored.
<br>

- **Reference** where the fields is a acollection/n array and/or is defined by another object.
- **Validation** applied to the field, including enumeration, field length and use of regular expressions to validate format.

Please note that string fields have a default maximum length of 256 characters unless specified otherwise.

## Transactions API

P2P Transfers can be created,  and viewed and updated using transactions APIs. The following paths are permitted:

*POST /transactions/type/transfer*. To create a P2P transfer.

*GET /transactions/{transactionReference}*. To view a P2P transfer.

The following paths are permitted:

| **Operation** | **Path**  | **Description** |
|:-----------|:-------|:-------------|
| **Create** | POST */transactions/type/{transactiontype}* | To be used for transaction creation when the providerâ€™s API Gateway requires that the transaction type be identified in the URL.  |
| **View** | GET */transactions/{transactionReference}* | To view a transaction. |
| **Update** | PATCH */transactions/{transactionReference}* | To update the transactionStatus of a transaction. |

## Accounts APIs

Using account APIs, an FSP can:

- View transfers for their account with another FSP.
- View their account balance with another FSP.
- Return the name of the intended recipient of a transfer.

### Identifying an FSP Account

Two methods are provided for identifying an FSP account, the single identifier method, and the multiple identifiers method.

#### Single Identifier Method

In the scenario where one identifier suffices to uniquely identify an account, the following path is to be used:
<br>

*`/accounts/{identifierType}/{identifier}`* .

#### Multiple Identifiers Method

Where a single identifier is not sufficient to identify an account, the following path is to be used:

*`/accounts/{accountIdentifier1}@{value1}${accountIdentifier2}@{value2}${accountIdentifier3}@{value3}`* .

The path uses a â€˜$â€™ delimiter to separate each identifier, up to a limit of three account identifiers. Each key/value is delimited by â€˜@â€™.

The list of permitted account identifiers supported by the Mobile Money API can be found in the [Account Identifiers](/use-cases/p-2-p-transfers/enumerations.html#account-identifiers) section.

## Account Transactions API

An FSP should use this API to return a list of payments transfers against their account. One of the following paths can be used:

GET `/accounts/{identifierType}/{identifier}/transactions`

or GET `/accounts/{Account Identifiers}/transactions`

To filter the number of records returned, the following query strings can be used:

| **Parameter** | **Type** | **Format** | **Description** |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **lLimit** | integer | N/A | Supports pagination. If this is not supplied, then the server will apply a limit of 50 records returned for each request. |
| **oOffset** | integer | N/A | Supports pagination. This value will indicate the cursor position from where to retrieve the set of records. For example, a limit of 50 and offset of 10 will return records 11 to 60. |
| **fromDateTime** | string | date-time | Indicates the minimum date creationDate for which records should be returned. |
| **toDateTime** | string | date-time | Indicates the maximum date creationDate for which records should be returned. |
| **transactionStatus** | string | N/A | Indicates the status of the transactions to be returned. |
| **transactionType** | string | N/A | Indicates the [type](/use-cases/p-2-p-transfers/enumerations.html#transaction-types) of the transactions to be returned. |

::: tip Note 1:
For a harmonised behavior, API Providers should make sure that the transactions are returned in descending date created order.
:::

::: tip Note 2:
HTTP response headers are returned with each response indicating the total number of records available (X-Records-Available-Count) and total number of records returned (X-Records-Returned-Count).

## Account Balances API

Using the Account Balances API, an FSP can check their balance. Permitted paths are: 

GET `/accounts/{identifierType}/{identifier}/balance`

or GET `/accounts/{Account Identifiers}/balance`

A â€˜selfâ€™ version is also available where the calling API client is the FSP account holder. Path for the â€˜selfâ€™ version is `/accounts/balance`.

### Account Balance Object Definition

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description** |  | **Reference** | **Validation** |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| **accountStatus** | string | Indicates a harmonised representation of the account state. This will be shown as â€˜availableâ€™ or â€˜unavailableâ€™. A state of â€˜unavailableâ€™ means that the account is in a state that does not allow posting of transactions. Unregistered indicates that although not available, a transaction created with the account identifier(s) will result in an unregistered voucher creation. | NA <br> O |  | Enumeration = available, unavailable, unregistered |
| **currentBalance** | string | The current outstanding balance on the account. | NA <br> O |  | Please refer to API Fundamentals document for amount validation rules. |
| **availableBalance** | string | Indicates the balance that is able to be debited for an account. This balance is only provided on some API provider systems. | NA <br> O |  | Please refer to API Fundamentals document for amount validation rules. |
| **reservedBalance** | string | Indicates the portion of the balance that is reserved, i.e. intended to be debited. This balance is only provided on some API provider systems. | NA <br> O |  | Please refer to API Fundamentals document for amount validation rules. |
| **unClearedBalance** | string | Indicates the sum of uncleared funds in an account, i.e. those that are awaiting a credit confirmation. | NA <br> O |  | Please refer to API Fundamentals document for amount validation rules. |
| **currency** | string | Currency for all returned balances. | NA <br> O |  | Enumeration = [ISO Currency Codes](/use-cases/p-2-p-transfers/enumerations.html#iso-currency-codes) |

## Account Holder Name API

Using the Account Holder Name API, a sending FSP can retrieve the name of the intended recipient of a transfer. This can then be provided to the sending account holder to confirm the recipient name is correct prior to authorising the transfer.  

Permitted paths are: 

GET `/accounts/{identifierType}/{identifier}/accountname`

or GET `/accounts/{Account Identifiers}/accountname`
