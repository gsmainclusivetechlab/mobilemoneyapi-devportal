    The purpose of this schema is to specify the endpoints, fields, objects, and enumerations for Account Linking Mobile Money APIs,
    which are a subset of the GSMA Mobile Money API Specification. The Account Linking Mobile Money APIs allow financial service providers
    to link customer accounts to mobile money accounts, thus allowing their customers to push funds to and pull funds from mobile money.
    Conversely, mobile money providers can use the APIs to link their customers mobile money accounts to financial service providers.

    You can find out more about what the API can do for your business at [https://developer.mobilemoneyapi.io]

      The **transaction** API can be used by FSPs to make a transfer for a linked account.
      Prior to making the transfer, a link must have been established between the debit and credit accounts.
  - name: Accounts
    description: |
      Using the Mobile Money APIs, financial service providers can:

      - View transfers for their account.

      - View their account balance.

      **Identifying a Target Account**

      Two methods are provided for identifying an account, the single identifier method and the multiple identifiers method.

      Single Identifier Method:

      - In the scenario where one identifier suffices to uniquely identify an account, the following path is to be used: **/accounts/{identifierType}/{identifier}**.

      Multiple Identifiers Method:

      - Where a single identifier is not sufficient to identify an account, the following path is to be used: &#39; **/accounts/{accountIdentifier1}@{value1}${accountIdentifier2}@{value2}${accountIdentifier3}@{value3}**&#39;. The list of permitted account identifiers supported by the Mobile Money API can be found in the API documentation. As there can be multiple identifiers required to identify the target account, the path uses a &#39;$&#39; delimiter to separate each identifier, up to a limit of three account identifiers.
  - name: Links
    description: |
      The **Links** APIs are used to establish a link between two separate accounts on the client and provider systems. The API can be used for example to link a mobile wallet account to a Microfinance Institution account or a bank account. The link object does not mandate the processes to verify and authenticate a link request - this depends upon the use case. A link needs to be associated with a mode of operation:

      - pull. The link can be used by the client to debit the target account held by the provider.
      - push. The link can be used by the client to credit the target account held by the provider.
      - both. The link can be used for Push and Pull requests.
  - name: Supporting
    description: |
      Supporting APIs consist of the following:

      - **Heartbeat API:** Used for monitoring purposes and establishes whether the system of an API provider is in a state that enables a client to submit a request for processing within established SLAs.
      - **Request State API** : Used to determine the state of an asynchronous request.
      - **Responses API** : In some circumstances, the client may not have received the final representation of the resource for which it attempted to create or update. The **Responses** API allows a client to identify and retrieve the final representation of the resource assuming that the resource was created.
