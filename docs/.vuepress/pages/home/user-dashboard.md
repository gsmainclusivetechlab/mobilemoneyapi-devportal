      The GSMA API Gateway is an example authentication gateway which adopts the best practice security recommendations of OAuth 2.0 and is built on the latest AWS API Gateway technology, thus giving providers an easy way to demonstrate how GSMA APIs could work in production with on-boarded service providers.  
      By registering with the GSMA developer portal, you will get access to a unique user dashboard home with direct access to all the tools required for utilisation of the GSMA API Gateway, sandbox environment and Postman collections with authentication.  Portal registration is simple and automated to give developers instant access to their user dashboard to create and view applications for selected products and view your unique API credentials (consumer keys and secrets) required for API access.
