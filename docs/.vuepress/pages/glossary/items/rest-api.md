##### REST-based API

</template>
<template v-slot:description>In computing, Representational State Transfer (REST) is the
software architectural style adopted by many organisations that offer APIs. REST
stipulates that interacting systems exhibit the following characteristics:
Client-Server. Responsibilities between clients and servers are explicitly defined.
Stateless. No context is stored between client and server during communication.
Cacheable. As on the World Wide Web, clients and intermediaries can cache responses
Layered System. A client cannot ordinarily tell whether it is connected directly to
the end server, or to an intermediary along the way. Uniform Interface. A uniform
interface simplifies and decouples the architecture, which enables each part to evolve
independently.
