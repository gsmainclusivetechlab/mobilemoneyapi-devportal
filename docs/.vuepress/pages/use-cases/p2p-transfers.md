## Introduction

The P2P Transfer Mobile Money APIs allow financial service providers (FSPs) to transfer funds from an account holding individual to another account holding individual or to a non-account holding individual (known as an unregistered customer). The API supports a wide number of financial service providers including mobile money providers, banks, and micro-finance institutions. The API supports ‘on-us’ P2P transfers (both accounts held within one FSP) and ‘off-us’ P2P transfers (accounts held in different FSPs). Bilateral and Switch-based transfers can be supported.
