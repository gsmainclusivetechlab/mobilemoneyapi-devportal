        <p>The Merchant Payment Mobile Money APIs allow merchants to accept payments from mobile money customers. Supported payment mechanisms include:</p>
        <p><b>Payee-initiated merchant payment.</b> The merchant initiates the payment and the payer is requested to authenticate to confirm acceptance by the mobile money provider. <br>
        <b>Payer-initiated merchant payment.</b> The payer initiates the payment by specifying the merchant that is to be paid.
        <b>Merchant payment via pre-authorised payment code.</b> The payer generates a payment authorisation code up to a maximum payment amount. The merchant then enters or scans (if rendered as a QR code) the payerâ€™s code to perform the payment.</p>
