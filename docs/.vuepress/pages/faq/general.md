                    Adoption of the Mobile Money API leads to key benefits including growth of your
                    mobile money ecosystem from faster partner on-boarding as partners will only
                    have to integrate to one common API. Adopting a harmonised API also leads to
                    easier maintenance and evolution of your common Mobile Money operations by
                    providing support for advanced features such as multi-wallets and batch
                    payments.
