The GSMA Mobile Money API SDK for node.js enables node.js developers to easily work with GSMA Mobile Money API Specification 1.2.0. Developers can build node.js server applications which can interact with mobile money APIs from a provider directly.
</p>
<p>
The SDK provides separate use cases to handle necessary GSMA API functionality including Merchant Payments, Disbursements, International Transfers, P2P Transfers, Recurring Payments, Account Linking, Bill Payments and Agent Services.  Each use case exposes use case scenarios to customise your application integrations as needed, and samples so you can test interactions before integration.
