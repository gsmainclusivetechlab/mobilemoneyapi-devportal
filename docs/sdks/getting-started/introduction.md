<p>
The GSMA have provided 5 SDKs which enable developers using 5 of the most common client and server application languages used today to easily work with GSMA Mobile Money API Specification 1.2.0. Developers can build client or server applications which can interact with mobile money APIs from a provider directly.
</p>

<p>
Each language SDK encapsulates support for each of the GSMA API use cases including Merchant Payments, Disbursements, International Transfers, P2P Transfers, Recurring Payments, Account Linking, Bill Payments and Agent Services (including Cash-In and Cash-Out).
</p>

<p>
Each language SDK contains all the libraries, documentation, code samples and tools developers require to build their solutions.
