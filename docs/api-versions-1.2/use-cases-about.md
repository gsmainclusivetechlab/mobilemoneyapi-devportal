## API Use Cases
We have evolved the API specification from the existing single technical specification view to provide additional API provider and API consumer perspectives for specific use case views for the following 8 use cases supported by the API: Merchant Payments, Disbursements, International Transfers, P2P Transfers, Recurring Payments, Account Linking, Bill Payments, Agent Services (including Cash-In and Cash-Out).  This will enable ecosystem players to easily see which parts of the specification are of interest to them, and more easily implement the relevant APIs using the single use case specification definitions provided.
