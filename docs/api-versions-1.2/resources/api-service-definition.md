# API Endpoints

API endpoint fields are described in this specification as follows:

- The field **name**.
- The field **type**.
- **Description** of the field.
- **Optionality** of the field, i.e. whether the field must be supplied. Optionality is identified as per follows:

&#8594;     Request optionality

&#8592;     Response optionality

O    Field is optional

M    Field is mandatory

C    Field is conditional

NA    Field does not need to be supplied. If supplied, it will be ignored.

- **Reference** where the fields is an array and/or is defined by another object.
- **Validation** applied to the field, including enumeration, field length and use of regular expressions to validate format.

Please note that string fields have a default maximum length of 256 characters unless specified otherwise.

## Transactions API

The Transactions APIs are used to support mobile money financial transaction use cases. Transactions are used for a wide range of use cases including merchant payments, international transfers, domestic transfers, and agent cash-in/cash-out.

The following paths are permitted:

| Operation     | Path          | Description  |
| ------------- |:-------------|------|
| POST          | POST <br> */transactions/type/{transactiontype}* | To be used for transaction creation when the provider’s API Gateway requires that the transaction type be identified in the URL. |
| View          | GET <br>  */transactions/{transactionReference}* |   To view a transaction. |
| Update | PATCH */transactions/{transactionReference}*  | To update the transactionStatus of a transaction.|

## Batch Transactions

The Mobile Money API allows clients to submit, approve and view batches of transactions. The following steps describe an end to end flow for processing batch transactions. Two types of processing modes are supported:

- One shot processing without an approver.
- Maker/checker approval, i.e. transactions are not completed until approved via a second API request.

The individual APIs that are referenced in the steps below are fully documented in subsequent sub-sections.

### Batch Transactions Workflow

### One-Shot Batch Processing

##### Creating a Batch

1. Client submits the batch for processing via POST /batchtransactions.

2. The client will return the requestState object indicating whether a callback will be provided or polling is required.

3. The API provider will parse the batch in order to determine whether the transactions are capable of being processed.

4. Once parsing has completed, the API provider will set the batch status in the batchTransactions object to ‘**completed**’.

##### Verifying a Batch

&nbsp;

5. The client will be able to retrieve the batch transaction object by invoking *GET /batchtransactions*  using the object reference provided by the *requestState* object. Alternatively, if Callback is specified, the client will receive the representation of the batchTransactions object to their nominated URL set in the *X-Callback-URL* header.

If errors are indicated, i.e. some of the transactions failed parsing, the client is able to retrieve the errors via *GET /batchtransactions/rejections*. Successfully completed transactions can be viewed via *GET /batchtransactions/completions*.
